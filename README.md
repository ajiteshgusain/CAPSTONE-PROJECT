🌌 Galaxy Express 999 Travel Authority Website

Project Overview

This project is a static website created for the first-semester Capstone Project in Web Development. The goal was to demonstrate fundamental knowledge of HTML structure and CSS styling by building a multi-section promotional site for a fictional intergalactic travel service, inspired by the classic space opera, Galaxy Express 999.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For content structure and semantic markup.

CSS3: For styling, colors, layout, and visual presentation.

Features

The website includes several essential components of a modern informational site, built using foundational web technologies:

Semantic Structure: Uses standard HTML5 tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>) to define the layout.

Thematic Styling: Employs a dark, retro-futuristic theme using custom CSS variables (e.g., --bg-deep-space, --engine-brass) for a consistent color palette.

Basic Navigation: A fixed header and navigation bar allow users to jump quickly between the site sections (Boarding, Itineraries, Conductor's Oath, etc.).

Promotional Sections: Includes a Hero banner, a list of "Galactic Itineraries," an "Eternal Pass" special offer, and traveler "Testimonial Logs."

Form Integration: A basic "Ticket Office & Reservations" section demonstrates the use of forms (<form>, <label>, <input>, <select>) for data collection.

File Structure

The project consists of two primary files:


Description

index.html

The main HTML file containing all the website content and structural markup.

style.css

The external CSS file containing all the styling rules, including colors, typography, spacing, and layout definitions.


This is a static site and does not require a web server.

Clone or Download: Ensure you have both capstone project dummy.html and style.css in the same directory on your computer.

Open: Locate the capstone project dummy.html file in your file explorer.

View: Double-click the file. It will automatically open in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
